## Architecture

## Overview 
Our work introduces a novel representation learning approach that incorporates drug response information during the domain-invariant representation learning phase. We also utilize weak supervision aided by subset selection to efficiently predict drug responses, leveraging patient genomic profiles without documented drug response.
